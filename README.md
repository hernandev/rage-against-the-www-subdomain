# Rage Against the WWW Subdomain


![stop](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Stop.png)

This is a manifesto against using www as the default subdomain on web applications and websites.

Reasons why we want a WWWless internet:

- Less caracteres for mobile users to type
- Unique URL's and no guessing about a website has or no www as a prefix
- @tbd
